### How it started

To have database was one of the requirements of the project. Started googling around and decided to go with mongoDB. While learning mongoDB, [Arunesh](https://github.com/arun-esh) came across the open databases from [mongoDB university](https://university.mongodb.com). Here is his [Proof of Completion](https://university.mongodb.com/course_completion/836e6c4a-4f7d-43ed-8ed0-24f0319d261b). 

Dataset `sample_airbnb` has vocation home listings and their reviews. This dataset has around 5000 entries and each entry has minimum of 30 fields. We needed a dataset which has decent content and also can easily be combined with frontend. 

**Initial Idea**

* Get a front page with all the locations
  * Add some basic info related to locations
    * location name
    * price
    * summary or description
    * number of bathrooms
    * number of bedrooms
    * image of the location
    * link to detailed information about the location
* Get few static pages
  * Login Page
  * Signup Page
  * About
  * Contact us
